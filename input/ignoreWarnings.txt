Reference to draft CodeSystem urn:iso:std:iso:3166:-2|2021 from fhir.tx.support.r4#0.29.0
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-adheresTo'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 5.1.0, 5.2.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-adheresTo' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-adheresTo|5.2.0'
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-triggeredBy'.

Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 5.1.0, 5.2.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-triggeredBy' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/workflow-triggeredBy|5.2.0'
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaireresponse-signature'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 4.0.1, 5.1.0, 5.2.0.

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex
